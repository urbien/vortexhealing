## VortexHealing documents

Various VortexHealing documents refer to life extension and health span extension techniques given in some classes. The following class documents list VortexHealing anti-aging tools:

- Genetics review is your main source of many anti-aging genmods
- Jewel: section: "Certain Specific Kinds of Conditions & Tissue Damage to Check for (to heal) with Aging"
- Death spot (everyone has it, needs UAP/MI to clear most of it). Adds ~3 years to life.
- Restore normal cellular functioning, which changed after the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). ISR is caused by injuries, virus, environmental factors, inflammation, cancer and many other stressors. Regardless of the stressor, ISR moves the cell into a mode of functioning, that reduces transcription from mRNA to proteins. It appears that sometimes cells get stuck in this mode, despite the disappearance of the stressor. An [experimental ISR inhibiting drug ISRIB](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/12/419201/drug-reverses-age-related-mental-decline-within-days) restores cognitive function in aged mice practically overnight. [Another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31913484/) on neural degeneration due to ISR reviews initial successes in reversing this process. 
(Use MG/UAP rifting or MI remanifesting. Start with the brain, then nervous system, then skin and other organs). 
- Heal & optimize mitochondria in the brain, and then in rest of the system (with Bioelectric Current)
- Heal/optimize the telomeres to slow aging (with Bioelectric Current)
- Bring up all constitutional energies by channelling MG structures with this intent (gets them up to 7)
- Bring all constitutional energies from 7 to 10 (MG directly into the pathways with this intent).
- “Background” structures for Jin Shin, acupuncture, & voridian systems (last 2 are not needed for Vortex students). They will add some years to a person's life. Source: search for "For everyone, for general health" in MS review.
- "Background" structure to add small amounts of pre-natal Jing (also called Baby Jing).  Pre-natal Jing "fathers" Chi and Chi gets converted to Kidney Essence (depletion of the latter accelerates aging). Note that you can also vortex into it for added effect. Source: search for "Baby Jing Structure" in MS review.
- Merlin's Grace (MG) class adds structures that greatly strengthen the energetic system and add large amounts pre-natal Jing, increase its conversion to Chi, and increase conversion of Chi to Kidney Essence, while harmonizing all 3 energies. Unfortunately you can't make these structures yourself, even at MI level. Source: search MG review for "Pre-Natal Jing, Chi & Kidney Essence"

## VortexHealers Facebook group

VortexHealers Facebook group has some posts on the subject:

- [Reversing shortening of telomeres](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1061656497234298/)
- [Improving heart performance and overall stamina](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1982412285158710)
- [Optimizing glands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/964449080288374)
- [Thymus activation](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3395590063840918/?comment_id=3395669413832983) (there were other comments / posts by Ric on FB group but I can't find them, after spending hours on this). Thymus may be key to longevity, see it discussed in my longevity review below.
- [Decreasing elevated blood pressure and sleep disruption](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3013750192024909). 
- [High cholesterol](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/)
- Healthspan genmods. Comments on [this post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/5159360644130509) mention the list given in Genetics class and also list a bunch of additional genmods for healthspan / longevity. Also see this [newer genmod intention](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/) that Ric discovered in 2021.
- Muscle loss with aging further accelerates aging. As one ages, to sustain muscle mass one needs exercise more and more. Or perhaps we should devise an intention for a genmod based on [this scientific insight](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4828086953924548/).

As with genmods for other non-age-related targets, we need consistent research and experimentation in this area. After all, average age of VortexHealing community member is quite high, as this type of inner work requires maturity. If we can address some of the aging processes, we can do healing of many diseases before and even after they emerge. See my review on recent [longevity breakthroughs](https://github.com/urbien/longevity). Note for example, a recent thymus regrowth experiment which resulted in the whole-body rejuvenation. Ric did an activation of his thymus, inspired by such research (post is somewhere on FB Group..).
