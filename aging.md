## VortexHealing documents

Various VortexHealing documents refer to life extension and health span extension techniques given in some classes. The following class documents list VortexHealing anti-aging tools:

- **Genetics review** document is your main source of over a dozen anti-aging genmods (search for "aging")
- **Jewel review** document lists tools for aging conditions & tissue damage, such as Diabetic tendency, blood vessels, osteoporosis, eyes, sub-clinical viruses, "leaky gut", imprints of long-term illness. For details search Jewel preview for "aging".
- **Death spot**. Everyone has it, clearing it adds ~3 years to life. Needs UAP/MI to clear. Search MG/UAP/MI projects file.
- **Recover from cellular stress**. Search for "ISR" in MG/UAP/MI projects document. Also note FB group post on [Recovering from cellular stress](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3860544094012177/). ISR (Integrated Stress Response) is like PTSD on a cellular level. ISR is a cellular mechanism that moves the cell into a specific state of resource preservation, in which it sometimes gets stuck. It may be triggered by the injury, an infection, environmental factors, inflammation, cancer, etc. An [experimental ISR-inhibiting drug ISRIB](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/12/419201/drug-reverses-age-related-mental-decline-within-days) has shown to restore cognitive function in aged mice practically overnight, with a lasting effect. [Another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31913484/) on neural degeneration due to ISR reviews initial successes in reversing this process.
- **Heal & optimize mitochondria** in the brain, and then in rest of the system (with Bioelectric Current)
- **Heal/optimize the telomeres** to slow aging (with Bioelectric Current).
- **Bring up all constitutional energies** by channelling MG structures with this intent (gets them up to 7). After that, bring all constitutional energies from 7 to 10 (MG directly into the pathways with this intent).
- **“Background” structures for Jin Shin**, acupuncture, & voridian systems (last 2 are not needed for Vortex students). They will add some years to a person's life. Source: search for "For everyone, for general health" in MS review.
- **Pre-natal Jing** (also called Baby Jing). Pre-natal Jing "fathers" Chi and Chi gets converted to Kidney Essence (depletion of the latter accelerates aging). Channel "background" structure with the intent to increase pre-natal Jing. You can later vortex into it for added effect. Source: search for "Baby Jing Structure" in MS review. This adds small amounts, see next for more.
- **Pre-natal Jing, Chi, Kidney Essence**. Merlin's Grace (MG) class adds structures that greatly strengthen the energetic system and add large amounts pre-natal Jing, increase its conversion to Chi, and increase conversion of Chi to Kidney Essence, while harmonizing all 3 energies. Unfortunately you can't make these structures yourself, even at MI level. Source: search MG review for "Pre-Natal Jing, Chi & Kidney Essence"
- **Weight issues**. Weight issues are often caused by aging and themselves cause aging. From genetics review: "For your Fat Cells: Scientists have found that slim people have more active fat cells than obese people. In slim people, their fat cells were both smaller and contained greater numbers of more active mitochondria (energy centers of cells), causing the fat cells to burn more energy in their “futile lipid cycle”. In contrast, more obese people often have faulty mitochondria in their fat cells, so they can’t burn energy as easily this way. So,
    - the genetic modification would be to get the mitochondria in your fat cells working more optimally.
    - UAP/MI wizards, can try using Bioelectric Current in their fat cells to optimize their mitochondria.

## VortexHealers Facebook group

VortexHealers Facebook group has some posts on the subject:

- [Reversing shortening of telomeres](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1061656497234298/)
- [Improving heart performance and overall stamina](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1982412285158710)
- [Optimizing glands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/964449080288374)
- [Thymus activation](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3395590063840918/?comment_id=3395669413832983). Recent thymus regrowth clinical study resulted in rolling back the age by 1.5 years (see it discussed in my longevity breakthroughs review below). Thymic involution starts at puberty and [is completed by the age of 60 in men and 70 in women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847950/). By that time normal thymic tissue is replaced with fat. Yet thymus has an innate ability to regrow. See below recent research in this field.
- [Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) and sleep disruption](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3013750192024909).
- [High cholesterol](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/)
- **Healthspan genmods**. As student in a comments on [this post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/5159360644130509) lists genmods given in Genetics class and also lists a bunch of additional genmods for healthspan / longevity. Also see this [newer genmod intention](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/) that Ric discovered in 2021.
- **Mitochondrial disfunction**. This is one of the hallmarks of aging.
    - [Ric suggested](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1976970349036237/?comment_id=1982038831862722&reply_comment_id=1990152267718045) to channel MG/UAP/MI to increase “cellular functions of mitochondria.”
    - [A student's suggestion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1976970349036237?comment_id=1982038831862722&reply_comment_id=2158549697544967) is to use MG/UAP/MI to "optimize metabolic pathways for healthy mitochondrial function”.
- **Cardiovascular**. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality. [Student's suggestion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1976970349036237?comment_id=2157138707686066): MG/UAP/MI for “optimizing all metabolic pathways to prevent adverse cardiovascular incidents.” (took several hours to complete for this student).
- **Brain and Teeth**. Gum infection has been linked to dementia. [Another student's suggestion it to use above intention for teeth health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1976970349036237?comment_id=2157138707686066&reply_comment_id=2158136897586247).
- [Hair issues](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3715113181888603/). How some students use VortexHealing tools to tackle this issue.
- [Weight issues](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/2474420975957836). As we age we gain weight due to the changes in metabolism. Above post mentions how one student tackled it (don't miss [this comment](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/2474420975957836?comment_id=2474484129284854&reply_comment_id=2474618505938083) on the above post). Also, look at the following post on [3 weight management genmods](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/2958028564263739). Also, note genmods and bioelectric current [suggested by Ric](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/2700426653357266/).
- Genetic kinks. Genetic analysis is fairly accessible now and we can work on our personal genetic kinks, e.g. what Ric did for his [Gilbert liver condition](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/2466411270092140/).

## Let's do our own genmod research!

As with genmods for other non-age-related targets, we need consistent research and experimentation in this area. After all, average age of VortexHealing community member is quite high. If we can address some of the aging processes, we can do prevent or heal many more diseases. See my review on recent [longevity breakthroughs](https://github.com/urbien/longevity).

By studying emerging bio research we could come up with new experimental genmods.

- **Age-related muscle loss** impacts metabolism, further accelerating aging. Perhaps we could devise an intention for a genmod based on [this scientific insight](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4828086953924548/).
- **Reversing Thymus atrophy**.
    - [This research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.706244/full) lists several strategies for regrowing the thymus.
    - Thymus is a bootcamp for T-Cells maturation. Apparently only 1% of immature T-Cells produced by bone marrow are selected by thymus, the rest are send to die. If "grave gets emptier" it signals for thymus to regrow. There are two signals and we can do genmods to attenuate each.
    - Research indicates that [sex hormones may be one of the causes of thymus atrophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12895). This is also supported by earlier research showing that [sex steroids ablation (SLA) rejuvenates both thymus and bone marrow](https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(15)00039-9). Same SLA effect on thymus regrowth is shown by [this research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039214/).
    - [Stress, and possibly ISR, can cause Thymus atrophy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.652538/full).
    - [Placenta Stem Cell (MSC) exosomes](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.640595/full) to regrow thymus. Genmod for that.
    - A [2022 review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41417-022-00427-8) showed that such exosomes can now be modified to deliver additional synthetic miRNA and mRNA material to further influence the epigenetic translation process. 
    - [Young blood exosomes to regrow thymus](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1096/fj.201800059R), Because this method influences the 2nd stage of epigenetic translation (from mRNA to proteins), it may call for epigenetic release, not genmod. Also this could be formulated in a genetics intervention e.g. "bringing bit of a young self's DNA".
- **Bringing in DNA bits**.
    - **Young blood fountain of youth**. Idea for intention: "bring in young blood factors from my own youth".
    - **Old blood poison**: Just a single infusion of old blood causes [senescence to quickly and robustly spread through young organism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35902645/). For more on senescence, search for it in my [longevity review](https://github.com/urbien/longevity).
        - Idea: "Bring in bits from ... to suppress or dilute old blood factors".
        - Idea (more specific): "Bring in bits from ... to clear old blood factors that cause senescence".
    - From placenta (see above). Mesenchymal Stem Cells exosomes are potent therapeutic agent in regenerative medicine. Exosomes bring new information into the cells. Perhaps we can use above intention or epigenetic intention to activate regeneration. [See review of MSC exosomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8399916/)
- **NAD boosting**. NAD molecule is extremely important in cell metabolism. It is part of 100+ metabolic processes, and its concentration decreases as we age. Multiple NAD boosters suppliments exist, yet they did not prove to be effective neither from [food sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-3GmgWO03k) nor from [supplements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ACcAwn18Q). What is the reason?
    - Lack of NAD recycling. It turns out for NAD supplementation to be effective, one needs to also improve NAD recycling.
    - Massive NAD destruction. In 2016 it was discovered that [CD38 enzyme degrades NAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj-CSSghDXo), and CD38 greatly increases with aging. A paper in 2022 showed that mice get [14% life extension and functional (e.g. muscle strength) and metabolic improvements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS4r4TqnsAc) with CD38 inhibitors, but most benefits are seen in the male mice. CD38 inhibitors exist in a half a dozen foods, but not in a [significant quantity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESCIfQp7z-U) to make a difference.
