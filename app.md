# VortexHealing App ideas

## Problem

VortexHealing protocols are complex due to many options and timing considerations. As a result many students just use a small subset of options they could memorize.

Note: The ideas in this document are based on brainstorming with other VortexHealer students.
(Please reach out to me if you are one of such contributors and want to have you name mentioned here).

Note: each set of ideas below has an empty slot - this is for the readers fill in :-)

See below what some ideas.

## Protocols options

Some information can be entered once, like your own level of training, other questions can be asked once when you first meet the patient:

- Has the patient lost their Core Veil yet?
- Their karmic knots? If not, make a suggestion and educate the patient.
- Would they consider multiple sessions? If so, offer to clear the most important energetic issues first (e.g. black holes).
- ...

Other questions can be specific to an issue:

- Does the issue present as a physical problem or emotional / mental? 
- What genetic component could the issue have?
- Was there a conflict in the ancestral lines?
- ...

## Keeping time

- give total time estimated for the session 
- start a timer for each step in the protocol (with either a custom sound or a visual cue)
- Apple Watch app offers an easy to feel vibration, which does not disturb a patient
- ...

## Reporting session back to client, accounting and billing

Henceforth time keeping can have such functions as:

- Generate a report to client on what was done for them. In my experience most healers don't produce a report, and those that do provide a more valuable service to their clients.
- An accounting function so that client knows what their money was spent on
- A billing function to let client know how much they need to pay, or how much credit they still got
- ...

## Community and Commerce

- A healer can refer to a higher-level more expensive student in their network, e.g to clear some things that one can't yet handle, like the Choice Points.
- A healer can refer for remote sensing or some other specialty work to another healer
- A healer can refer to their apprentice to work on many things that do not require a higher level of training
- ...

## Encouraging healer's intuition

The app should be designed to help develop healer's sensing and intuition, 
instead of working like Google Maps, where healer follows it blindly.

- Should offer a way to skip the rest of the allotted time for a protocol step
- It could offer explanation why it chose this or that option
- It could make, once in a while, a suggestion for a particular sensing option
- ...
