I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021 and see objective measurable improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment. 

I have a drive to give back to the VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below you can find the initial ideas that I am discussing with other VortexHealing students.

VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public.
