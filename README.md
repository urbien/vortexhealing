# Introduction and motivation
I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021. I see objective (measurable) improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment, the [self-transcendence](https://www.mistysansom.com/blog/spirituality-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs) in Maslow's pyramid of needs.

This led to a desire to give back to VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below is a set of potential projects that emmerged from discussions with other VortexHealing students. Those projects, if come to life, will fill the need of VortexHeling community and bring awareness of its magic to people that are not part of it, but could benefit from its healing tools.

## Increase accessibility of VortexHealing documentation
Students can collaborate with teachers of VortexHealing classes to increase accessibility of class review documents and other VortexHealing content:

- Solve problems of viewing on mobile devices by converting documents into HTML format. All modern browsers support HTML zooming, reflowing the content for a narrower view, which PDF does not do and Word on mobile does not do either.
- Automatically producing all documents in Kindle and Apple Books formats (epub and mobi formats). 
- Generating table of contents for each document (and fixing headers to improve generated ToCs)
- Collaboratively edit documents to fix errors in text and improve readability, and to interlink documents to make it easier to find relevant definitions, protocols, and explanations. This can be done either via Google docs, Wikis or via [Github markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/collaboration.html). Those newer tools have long replaced the Word Document worlflow, used still by VortexHealers teachers. 
- Adding relevant art and photos for each document, protocol, issue series, class. Images can come from the following sites: [add suggested sites here]
- Alternatively, generate such art with [generative art](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)

## Mirrorring VortexHealers Facebook group
Many sudents have a strong aversion to Facebook and therefore can't access the treasure trove of information accumulated in the last 10 years on this group. It is a shame many students are not part of the conversation and in post-COVID world with most classes moving online, they feel they are disconnected from the community. Many students are not even aware of all the questions that have been asked and answered already, and keep asking them in classes and events. 

- Create a mirror copy of the Facebook group, automatically syncing it to the student area of VortexHealing.org website
- Allow to post and comment on this website, auto-propagating the content back to the Facebook Group

## Search engine for all things vortex
Many students completely forgot the tools and protocols that were taught in prior classes, and have hard time finding them in docs. Also, finding some prior posts in the Facebook Vortexhealers group is very hard, sometimes takes hours, and sometimes impossible. That is even if you know who made the post and know the exact keywords. This is not good. Search should work across all the materials:

- All VortexHealing documents 
- Vortexhealing.org site, including testimonies, healing stories, etc.
- Search Facebook VortexHealers Group 
- Search an archive of Ric's emails 
- Ric's books
- AI to train on above VortexHealing content to improve the quality of automatic langauge translation 

## Research for genmod targets
There is a lot of ideas in Genetics class review manual on what can be done with Genetics tools. What is missing is an ongoing discussion on what worked, what did not. VortexHealers Facebook group has a number of posts on this topic. Yet we need more focused discusson and exploration of progressive improvements in this area based on the new scientific data that arises and based on all the digital measurements and monitoring of the body that can be done nowadays, which was not possible earlier. 

## Healthspan, Anti-aging, Longevity, Youthening, Rejuvenation
Various VortexHealing documents refer to life extension and health span extension techniques given in some classes. VortexHealers group has some posts on the subject:

- [shortened telomeres](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1061656497234298/)
- [on the heart performance and stamina](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1982412285158710)
- [glands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/964449080288374)
- [thymus activation]() (still searching for this post)
- [elevated blood pressure and sleep disruption](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3013750192024909)
- [genmods](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/5159360644130509). Also see this [newer genmod intention](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/) that Ric discovered in 2021.

As with genmod for other non-age-related targets, we need consistent research and experimentation in this area. After all, average age of VortexHealing community member is quite high, as this type of inner work requires maturity. If we can address some of the aging procsses, we can do healing of many deseases before and even after they emerge. See my prior article on recent [longevity breakthroughs](https://github.com/urbien/longevity). Note for example, a recent thymus regrowth experiment which resulted in the whole-body rejuvenation. Ric did an activation of his thymus, inspired by such research.

# For VortexHealing practicioners

## Modular site 
Most healers have no sites or have the rudimentary sites. Create a way to quickly customize a website with standard sections and tools, like these:

- Bio 
- Calendar of events
- Booking to events 
- Auto-reminders for events
- Official Certificate for the current level of VortexHealing training 
- Media: audio and video recordings
- Testimonies
- Catalog: a list of offered services and their prices
- Accept payments 
    - Paypal and credit cards, obviating the need to send emails back and forth
    - Subscriptions to a block of events / sessions
    - Monthly subscriptions

## VortexHealing practice development
VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work developement. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. 

- Longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels)
- Preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- Grief counceling (e.g. via hospitals)
- Marriage and relationship support
- Breakup and divorce support 
- Rape cases support
- Long covid help, like clearing pathways for restoring the sense of taste and smell
- Clearing infections, including secondary for covid 
- Lyme desease and long Lyme
- Genmod for known genetic risks (via the national lab networks??)
- Support the therapy and deep wound release  
- Support other mental conditions like Bipolar, Schizophrenia, if due to a virus
- Support for autoimmune deseases, if due to a virus
- New home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.
- Unresolved parent issues
- Losing weight, improving digestion 
- Loosing hair 
- Energy system check up and repair (via longevity networks)
- Meridians unreachable with needles (via accupuncturists networks)
- Karmic knots (via Buddhist schools??)
- Fear of exams (via prep schools, tutoring marketplaces)
- Fear of public speaking (e.g. via an MBA school)
- Elected to public office that have deep wound
- Relief for the side-effects of cancer treatments like chemo or radiation (via marihuana dispenseries??, via dedicated Facebook groups??)

# For VortexHealing Teachers 
## Modular site
Similar to a site for practicioners, but also classes, their reviews, discussions, wizard upkeep and morning routine. 

## Zoom tools 
A synchronous translation of classes is important. I have a friend in Germany who does not speak English. I am sure the same is true in China, Japan, and other countries that have low general knowledge of English. This severely limits the reach of VortexHealing to the planet.

- Auto-generation of subtitles for Zoom-based classes in real-time like Youtube does it. Some people can read but it is hard for them to quickly understand the spoken word, especially with Irish, Australian and US Midwest accents.
- [Auto-translation](https://integrately.com/integrations/google-translate/zoom) of those subtitles into other languages
- AI to train translator on VortexHealing vocabulary to improve the quality of the above

## Internship program for VortexHealing teachers
There is a currebtly a skills gap between graduating from the vortex class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. COnsider this an equivalent of the internship program that 

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with lead practicioner and junior practicioners

## Mobile App
An app to help students with the study and practice (let's discuss what this app could do).

# General VortexHealing awareness program
- Interviews on Youtube with teachers, and some students that can tell an interesting story
- Do a TED talk. This can be done both by teachers and students.
- Do a Google Talk like mindfulness guys did
- Do conversations with people who attract deep thinkers like Uval Harari, Sam Harris
- Present at the Singularity Conference
- Work with the astronauts who are preparing for a long stay at the space station, Lunar base, and for the Mars mission
