I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021. I see objective (measurable) improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment and [self-transcendence](https://www.mistysansom.com/blog/spirituality-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs) in Maslow's pyramid of needs.

This led to a desire to give back to VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering.

Below is a set of potential projects that emerged from the discussions with other VortexHealing students. Those projects, if come to life, will fill the need of VortexHealing community and bring awareness of its magic to people that are not part of it, but could benefit from its healing tools, or could wish to join it.

## Increase accessibility of VortexHealing documentation

I have encountered a number of time the difficulty less technical students experience with class documents. Besides some texts could be made much easier to understand. Currently all the editing of the materials falls onto Ric (or teachers that offer their own unique classes).

Using modern tools and workflows, this burden can be lifted somewhat. One might think that improvement requests could flood Ric's and other teachers inboxes. But advanced students can be assigned the role of reviewing the document improvement requests, suggested by other students. If suggestion needs an improvement, the reviewer can send it back to the submitting student for correction. And only after the approval this could come to Ric for the final ok, where Ric can deny or accept the request, or make an adjustment. Thus students can collaborate with teachers to increase accessibility of class review documents and other VortexHealing content. Below are some ideas on this:

- Solve problems of viewing on mobile devices by automatically converting documents into an HTML format. All modern browsers support HTML zooming and reflowing the content for a narrower view, which PDF does not do at all, and Word does not do on mobiles (I tested with another student an automatic conversion of all doc files into .docx, and from there there is an automatic conversion of all documents to html, epub, wiki, and any other formats one would desire).
- Automatically convert all documents to Kindle and Apple Books formats (that is epub formats. Note that Kindle now uses its own format, but by the end of 2022 they promised to support epub standard). 
- Automatically generate the table of contents for each document (headers in current documents need to be fixed manually for small number of cases where teachers use large font instead of a proper heading)
- Collaboratively edit documents to fix errors in text and improve readability, and to interlink documents to make it easier to find relevant definitions,  protocols, and explanations. This can be done either via Google docs, Wikis or via [Github markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/collaboration.html). Those newer tools have long replaced the Word Document workflow, used still by VortexHealers teachers.
- Adding relevant art and photos for each document, protocol, issue series, class. Images can come from the following sites: [add suggested sites here].
- Alternatively, generate such art with [generative art](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

## Mirroring VortexHealers Facebook group

Many students have a strong aversion to Facebook and therefore can't access the treasure trove of information accumulated in the last 10 years on this group. It is a shame many students are not part of the conversation and in a post-COVID world, with most classes moving online, they feel they are disconnected from the community. Many students are not even aware of all the questions that have been asked and answered already, and keep asking them in classes and events. 
An alternative forum capability on VortexHealing.org [was discussed in 2015](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/987140791352536/) by Ric and Anthony, but it never took hold. Perhaps Anthony hit some technical issues or our Facebook forum admins provided some manual support with the help of a pinned thread as a make shift bulletin board.

The difficulty lies in is not asking students to create Facebook profiles while:

1) automatically posting under their names on FB (hope this will be acceptable for FB-averse students)
2) allowing only registered students to post on the <https://vortexhealing.org> forum
3) giving admins an ability to suspend users

Here is the proposed solution, based on some [new tech](https://github.com/mautrix/facebook). It is a bridge between [Matrix](https://matrix.org), the world's [most secure group messaging solution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UlA4-tslROBDS9IqHalWVztqZo7uxlCeKPQ-8uoFOU/edit#gid=0), which is also 100% open source.

- Create a mirror copy of the Facebook group, automatically syncing it to the student area of VortexHealing.org website.
- Allow to post and comment on this website and propagate automatically these posts back to current Facebook Group.

Assuming this works, those who like to continue using Facebook Group will be able to do so without any changes, and the rest of the community can join the conversation.

And even if it does not work for bi-directional syncing, it is still very valuable to sync one-way for a search engine to index 10+ years of conversations on FB Group, and for the AI to learn our vortex lingo.

## Search engine for all things vortex

Many students completely forgot the tools and protocols that were taught in prior classes, and have hard time finding them in docs. Also, finding some prior posts in the Facebook VortexHealers group is very hard, sometimes takes hours, and sometimes is plain impossible. This is not good. That is even if you know who made the post and know the exact keywords. Modern google-like search should allow to find materials using so called facets (post: or comment:) by a specific person (person:) or or during a specific time frame (a month ago, a year ago, last 5 years, etc.).
Search should work across all the materials:

- <https://Vortexhealing.org> site, including testimonies, healing stories, etc. (public)
- Ric's books (public, but should only show the limited pages of the book, like Amazon.com does it)
- All VortexHealing documents (non-public, in student area)
- All VortexHealing documents German and Spanish (non-public, in student area)
- Search an archive of Ric's emails (non-public, in student area)
- Search Facebook VortexHealers Group (non-public, in student area, behind a personal student login)

With the above projects we will have a large corpus of text that will help us train AI to improve the quality of automatic language translation for Zoom and for other AI-based projects.

## Collaborative research on genmod targets

There is a lot of ideas in Genetics class review manual on what can be done with Genetics tools. What is missing is an ongoing discussion on what worked, what did not. VortexHealers Facebook group has a number of posts on this topic. Yet we need more focused discussion and exploration of progressive improvements in this area based on the new scientific data that arises and based on all the digital measurements and monitoring of the body that can be done nowadays, which was not possible earlier.

## VortexHealers practice development

Many students would want to become practitioners, but they need help with technology and practice development. See the [document](practice.md) on this topic.

## General VortexHealing awareness program

- Youtube (or Spotify) interviews with VortexHealing teachers, like Ric did with [Awareness Explorers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xv-CELriII)
- Youtube (or Spotify) interviews with students, like Daisy did in 2022 on [Initiating Awakening](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bWjfi75nVFFTtLMbbwHvx) and [Sex and Relationships](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7xtgyqm4zwUwEtLiC8m4Da). I heard some pretty juicy and entrancing stories from VortexHealing students, which I found inspiring for myself, and may inspire others. I know these things work, as I also shared my VortexHealing and Path stories with others, and even though some were higher-level students or at least were doing VortexHealing for much longer than I did, they were encouraged to try some new things and intensify their own practice.

- Do recorded conversations with deep thinkers like Yuval Harari, Sam Harris, etc.
- Do a Google Talk like the mindfulness guys did, which opened it up to a completely new audience.
- Do a TED talk. This can be done both by teachers and students.
- Present at the Singularity Conference. This could bring completely new group of people into VortexHealing.
- Work with the astronauts who are preparing for a long stay at the space station, Lunar base, and for the Mars mission. These extreme situations expose inner unresolved issues. It was well depicted in the show For All Mankind.

## Mobile and Web App

An app to help students with the study and practice.
Here are some [initial ideas](app.md). Let's brainstorm what this app could do.
