# Introduction and motivation
I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021. I see objective (measurable) improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment, or [self-transcendence](https://www.mistysansom.com/blog/spirituality-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs) in Maslow's pyramid of needs.

This led to a desire to give back to VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below is a set of potential projects that emmerged from discussions with other VortexHealing students. Those projects, if come to life, will fill the need of VortexHealing community and bring awareness of its magic to people that are not part of it, but could benefit from its healing tools, or could wish to join it.

## Increase accessibility of VortexHealing documentation
I have encountered a number of time the difficulty less technical students experience with class documents. Besides some texts could be made much easier to understand. Currently all the editing of the materials falls onto Ric (or teachers that offer their own unique classes).

Using modern tools and workflows, this burden can be lifted somewhat. One might think that improvement requests could flood Ric's and other teachers inboxes. But advanced students can be assigned the role of reviewing the document improvment requests, suggested by other students. If suggestion needs an improvement, the reviewer can send it back to the submitting student for correction. And only after the approval this could come to Ric for the final ok, where Ric can deny or accept the request, or make an adjustment. Thus students can collaborate with teachers to increase accessibility of class review documents and other VortexHealing content. Below are some ideas on this:

- Solve problems of viewing on mobile devices by automatically converting documents into an HTML format. All modern browsers support HTML zooming and reflowing the content for a narrower view, which PDF does not do at all, and Word does not do on mobiles (I tested with another student an automatic conversion of all doc files into .docx, and from there there is an automatic converstion of all documents to html, epub, wiki, and any other formats one would desire).
- Automatically convert all documents to Kindle and Apple Books formats (that is epub formats. Note that Kindle now uses its own format, but by the end of 2022 they promised to support epub standard). 
- Automatically generate the table of contents for each document (headers in current documents need to be fixed manually for small number of cases where teachers use large font instead of a proper heading)
- Collaboratively edit documents to fix errors in text and improve readability, and to interlink documents to make it easier to find relevant definitions, protocols, and explanations. This can be done either via Google docs, Wikis or via [Github markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/collaboration.html). Those newer tools have long replaced the Word Document worlflow, used still by VortexHealers teachers. 
- Adding relevant art and photos for each document, protocol, issue series, class. Images can come from the following sites: [add suggested sites here].
- Alternatively, generate such art with [generative art](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

## Mirrorring VortexHealers Facebook group
Many students have a strong aversion to Facebook and therefore can't access the treasure trove of information accumulated in the last 10 years on this group. It is a shame many students are not part of the conversation and in a post-COVID world, with most classes moving online, they feel they are disconnected from the community. Many students are not even aware of all the questions that have been asked and answered already, and keep asking them in classes and events. 
An alternative forum capability on VortexHealing.org [was discussed in 2015](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/987140791352536/) by Ric and Anthony, but it never materialized. Perhaps Anthony hit some technical issues or our Facebook forum admins provideed some manual support with the help of a pinned thread as a make shift bulletin board. Here is the proposed solution, based on some [new tech](https://github.com/mautrix/facebook):

- Create a mirror copy of the Facebook group, automatically syncing it to the student area of VortexHealing.org website.
- Allow to post and comment on this website and propagate automatically these posts back to current Facebook Group.

Assuming this works, those who like to continue using Facebook Group will be able to do so without any changes, and the rest of the community can join the conversation.

## Search engine for all things vortex
Many students completely forgot the tools and protocols that were taught in prior classes, and have hard time finding them in docs. Also, finding some prior posts in the Facebook Vortexhealers group is very hard, sometimes takes hours, and sometimes is plain impossible. This is not good. That is even if you know who made the post and know the exact keywords. Modern google-like search should allow to find materials using so called facets (post: or comment:) by a specific person (person:) or or during a specific timeframe (a month ago, a year ago, last 5 years, etc.). 
Search should work across all the materials:

- All VortexHealing documents 
- Vortexhealing.org site, including testimonies, healing stories, etc.
- Search Facebook VortexHealers Group 
- Search an archive of Ric's emails 
- Ric's books
- AI to train on above VortexHealing content to improve the quality of automatic langauge translation 

## Research for genmod targets
There is a lot of ideas in Genetics class review manual on what can be done with Genetics tools. What is missing is an ongoing discussion on what worked, what did not. VortexHealers Facebook group has a number of posts on this topic. Yet we need more focused discusson and exploration of progressive improvements in this area based on the new scientific data that arises and based on all the digital measurements and monitoring of the body that can be done nowadays, which was not possible earlier. 

## Healthspan, Anti-aging, Longevity, Youthening, Rejuvenation
Various VortexHealing documents refer to life extension and health span extension techniques given in some classes. VortexHealers group has some posts on the subject:

- [Reversing shortening of telomeres](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1061656497234298/)
- [Improving heart performance and overal stamina](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1982412285158710)
- [Optimizing glands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/964449080288374)
- [Thymus activation]() (still searching for this post)
- [Decreasing elevated blood pressure and sleep disruption](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3013750192024909)
- [Healthspan genmods](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/5159360644130509). Also see this [newer genmod intention](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/) that Ric discovered in 2021.
- [Thymus activation](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3395590063840918/?comment_id=3395669413832983). Thymus may be key to longevity, see it discussed in my longevity review below.

As with genmod for other non-age-related targets, we need consistent research and experimentation in this area. After all, average age of VortexHealing community member is quite high, as this type of inner work requires maturity. If we can address some of the aging procsses, we can do healing of many deseases before and even after they emerge. See my review on recent [longevity breakthroughs](https://github.com/urbien/longevity). Note for example, a recent thymus regrowth experiment which resulted in the whole-body rejuvenation. Ric did an activation of his thymus, inspired by such research.

# For VortexHealing practicioners

## Modular site 
Most healers have no sites or have the rudimentary sites. Create a way to quickly customize a website with standard sections and tools, like these:

- Bio 
- Calendar of events
- Booking to events 
- Auto-reminders for events
- Official Certificate for the current level of VortexHealing training 
- Media: audio and video recordings
- Testimonies
- Catalog: a list of offered services and their prices
- Accept payments 
    - Paypal and credit cards, obviating the need to send emails back and forth
    - Subscriptions to a block of events / sessions
    - Monthly subscriptions

## VortexHealing practice development
VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work developement. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. 

- Longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels)
- Preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- Grief counceling (e.g. via hospitals)
- Marriage and relationship support
- Breakup and divorce support 
- Rape cases support
- Long covid help, like clearing pathways for restoring the sense of taste and smell
- Clearing infections, including secondary for covid 
- Lyme desease and long Lyme
- Genmod for known genetic risks (via the national lab networks??)
- Support the therapy and deep wound release  
- Support other mental conditions like Bipolar, Schizophrenia, if due to a virus
- Support for autoimmune deseases, if due to a virus
- New home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.
- Unresolved parent issues
- Losing weight, improving digestion 
- Loosing hair 
- Energy system check up and repair (via longevity networks)
- Meridians unreachable with needles (via accupuncturists networks)
- Karmic knots (via Buddhist schools??)
- Fear of exams (via prep schools, tutoring marketplaces)
- Fear of public speaking (e.g. via an MBA school)
- Elected to public office that have deep wound
- Relief for the side-effects of cancer treatments like chemo or radiation (via marihuana dispenseries??, via dedicated Facebook groups??)

# For VortexHealing Teachers 
## Modular site
Similar to a site for practicioners, but also classes, their reviews, discussions, wizard upkeep and morning routine. 

## Zoom tools 
A synchronous translation of classes is important. I have a friend in Germany who does not speak English. I am sure the same is true in China, Japan, and other countries that have low general knowledge of English. This severely limits the reach of VortexHealing to the planet.

- Auto-generation of subtitles for Zoom-based classes in real-time like Youtube does it. Some people can read but it is hard for them to quickly understand the spoken word, especially with Irish, Australian and US Midwest accents.
- [Auto-translation](https://integrately.com/integrations/google-translate/zoom) of those subtitles into other languages
- AI to train translator on VortexHealing vocabulary to improve the quality of the above

## IDEA: Internship program for VortexHealing teachers
There is currently a skills gap between graduating from the VortexHealing class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. Consider this to be an equivalent of the internship program for medical professionals.

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with lead practicioner and junior practicioners

## Mobile App
An app to help students with the study and practice (let's discuss what this app could do).

# General VortexHealing awareness program
- Youtube (or Spotify) interviews with VortexHealing teachers, like Ric did with [Awareness Explorers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xv-CELriII)
- Youtube (or Spotify) interviews with students, like Daisy did in 2022 on [Initiating Awakening](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bWjfi75nVFFTtLMbbwHvx) and [Sex and Relationships](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7xtgyqm4zwUwEtLiC8m4Da). I heard some pretty juicy and entrancing stories from VortexHealing students, which I found inspiring for myself, and may inspire others. I know these things work, as I also shared my VortexHealing and Path stories with others, and even though some were higher-level students or at least were doing VortexHealing for much longer than I did, they were encouraged to try some new things and intensify their own practice. 
- Do a TED talk. This can be done both by teachers and students.
- Do a Google Talk like the mindfulness guys did, which opened it up to a completely new audience.
- Do recorded conversations with people who attract deep thinkers like Uval Harari, Sam Harris
- Present at the Singularity Conference. This could bring completely new group of people into VortexHealing.
- Work with the astronauts who are preparing for a long stay at the space station, Lunar base, and for the Mars mission. These extreme situations expose inner unresolved issues. It was well depicted in the show For All Mankind.

# Tips for students 
## What would be good to do after Core Veil is gone?
I asked this question to many wizards and did not get a clear answer. So I ended up just clearing the voridians. We all have seen the notes scattered around the class review documents saying that this and that could be done only after Core Veil. Let's gather these up and rate them by the impact. 
Below is the list that I suggest we start building:

1. [Weaken the Network of Networks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1620368921363050/). This will significantly weaken all the conditioning in your system and make it easier to address each issue separately.
2. De-networking room in Quinstel.
3. 

## If I had the money to spend, what should I invest into to upgrade my energetic system?
Let's build the list.  and add the most important steps of the energy system tune up (MG - UAP - MI projects document) that can be done after losing the Core Veil.

## Conditions for which VortexHealing may be helpful
I have spent dozens of hours researching various conditions for myself and friends-and-family. I feel there should be a better way. This is also a way for healers to earn some income, by communicating these on their websites (must be careful with wording to avoid legal issues).
Here are the list I suggest we start building:

### Body
- Allergies
- Autoimmune 
- Hypertension (high blood pressure)
- Infections
- COVID
- Anemia
- Headache 

### Mental health 
- Anxiety 
- Autism
- ADHD
- Schizophrenia 
- Bipolar
- 

### Awakening
It is generally assumed In VortexHealing community that for awakening you need classes. It is true, but you can do more. For example, I have worked towards my awakening goals with a number of MI and UAP students as I did not have all the prerequisites yet for the awakening classes. If you have a strong drive and [quite] some money to spend, this is possible. It is also healthy as it is mutually beneficial - hardcore seekers can accelerate their highly desired development and the higher level students can gain extra sustenance.

- Helping you get through 14 energetic movements (there is a separate document on this in student area download section). After the Omega class you will be at the 14th, but if you are one of those spiritual seekers like me who can't wait, below is for you. I have done it, it is possible.
- Help with loosing the Core Veil prior to the Core Veil class. You need 14 EC prior to that and then what worked for me was a number of sessions with the higher level students channeling Presence (Omega level) and Surrender / Grace (Jewel-level).
