# Introduction and motivation
I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021 and see objective measurable improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment. 

I have a drive to give back to the VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below you can find the initial ideas that I am discussing with other VortexHealing students.

## VortexHealing community development ideas

## Internship program 
There is a gap between graduating from the vortex class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. COnsider this an equivalent of the internship program that 

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with lead practicioner and junior practicioners

## Healing practice development
VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work developement. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. 

- executives - fear of public speaking (e.g. via an MBA school)
- elected to public office that have deep wound
- longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels)
- preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- grief counceling (e.g. via hospitals)
- marriage and relationship support
- breakup and divorce support 
- rape support
- long covid help
- infections, including secondary for covid 
- labs for genetic risks (via the national lab networks??)
- therapy and deep wound release  
- new home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.
- unresolved parent issues
- losing weight, improving digestion 
- loosing hair 
- energy system check up and repair
- meridians unreachable with needles (via accupuncturists networks)
- karmic knots (via buddhists schools??)
- fear of exams (via prep schools, tutoring marketplaces)
- post-chemo and radiation for cancer (via marihuana dispenseries??)
