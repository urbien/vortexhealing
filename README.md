# Introduction and motivation
I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021. I see objective (measurable) improvements with my health and subjective improvements of my human potential unfoldment, the [self-transcendence](https://www.mistysansom.com/blog/spirituality-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs) in Maslow's pyramid of needs.

I have a drive to give back to the VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below is a set of potential projects that emmerged from discussions with other VortexHealing students, projects that will serve VortexCommunity and bring awareness of its magic to people that are not part of it, but could benefit from its healing tools.

## Increase accessibility of VortexHealing documentation
Students can collaborate with teachers of VortexHealing classes to increase accessibility of class review documents and other VortexHealing content:

- Solve problems of viewing on mobile devices by converting documents into HTML format. All modern browsers support HTML zooming, reflowing the content for a narrower view, which PDF does not do and Word on mobile does not do either.
- Automatically producing all documents in Kindle and Apple Books formats (epub and mobi formats). 
- Generating table of contents for each document (and fixing headers to improve generated ToCs)
- Collaboratively edit documents to fix errors in text and improve readability, and to interlink documents to make it easier to find relevant definitions, protocols, and explanations. This can be done either via Google docs, Wikis or via [Github markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/collaboration.html). Those newer tools have long replaced the Word Document worlflow, used still by VortexHealers teachers. 
- Adding relevant art and photos for each document, protocol, issue series, class. Images can come from the following sites: [add suggested sites here]
- Alternatively, generate such art with [generative art](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)

## Mirrorring VortexHealers Facebook group
Many sudents have a strong aversion to Facebook and therefore can't access the treasure trove of information accumulated in the last 10 years on this group. It is a shame many students are not part of the conversation and in post-COVID world with most classes moving online, they feel they are disconnected from the community. Many students are not even aware of all the questions that have been asked and answered already, and keep asking them in classes and events. 

- Create a mirror copy of the Facebook group, automatically syncing it to the student area of VortexHealing.org website
- Allow to post and comment on this website, auto-propagating the content back to the Facebook Group

## Search engine for all things vortex
Many students completely forgot the tools and protocols that were taught in prior classes, and have hard time finding them in docs. Search should work across all the materials:

- All VortexHealing documents 
- Vortexhealing.org site, including testimonies, healing stories, etc.
- Search Facebook Group 
- Search an archive of Ric's emails 
- Ric's books
- AI to train on above VortexHealing content to improve the quality of automatic langauge translation 

# For VortexHealing practicioners

## Modular site 
Most healers have no sites or have the rudimentary sites. Create a way to quickly customize a website with standard sections and tools, like these:

- Bio 
- Calendar of events
- Booking to events 
- Auto-reminders for events
- Official Certificate for the current level of VortexHealing training 
- Media: audio and video recordings
- Testimonies
- Catalog: a list of offered services and their prices
- Accept payments 
    - Paypal and credit cards, obviating the need to send emails back and forth
    - Subscriptions to a block of events / sessions
    - Monthly subscriptions

## VortexHealing practice development
VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work developement. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. 

- Longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels)
- Preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- Grief counceling (e.g. via hospitals)
- Marriage and relationship support
- Breakup and divorce support 
- Rape cases support
- Long covid help, like clearing pathways for restoring the sense of taste and smell
- Clearing infections, including secondary for covid 
- Lyme desease and long Lyme
- Genmod for known genetic risks (via the national lab networks??)
- Support the therapy and deep wound release  
- Support other mental conditions like Bipolar, Schizophrenia, if due to a virus
- Support for autoimmune deseases, if due to a virus
- New home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.
- Unresolved parent issues
- Losing weight, improving digestion 
- Loosing hair 
- Energy system check up and repair (via longevity networks)
- Meridians unreachable with needles (via accupuncturists networks)
- Karmic knots (via Buddhist schools??)
- Fear of exams (via prep schools, tutoring marketplaces)
- Fear of public speaking (e.g. via an MBA school)
- Elected to public office that have deep wound
- Relief for side-effects of cancer treatments like chemo or radiation (via marihuana dispenseries??)

# For VortexHealing Teachers 
## Modular site
Similar to a site for practicioners, but also classes, their reviews, discussions, wizard upkeep and morning routine. 

## Zoom tools 
A synchronous translation of classes is important. I have a friend in Germany who does not speak English. I am sure the same is true in China, Japan, and other countries that have low general knowledge of English. This severely limits the reach of VortexHealing to the planet.

- Auto-generation of subtitles for Zoom-based classes in real-time like Youtube does it. Some people can read but it is hard for them to quickly understand the spoken word, especially with Irish, Australian and US Midwest accents.
- [Auto-translation](https://integrately.com/integrations/google-translate/zoom) of those subtitles into other languages
- AI to train translator on VortexHealing vocabulary to improve the quality of the above

## Internship program for VortexHealing teachers
There is a currebtly a skills gap between graduating from the vortex class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. COnsider this an equivalent of the internship program that 

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with lead practicioner and junior practicioners

## Mobile App
An app to help students with the study and practice (let's discuss what this app could do).

# General VortexHealing awareness program
- Youtube interviews
- Go do a Google Talk like mindfulness guys did
- Do a TED talk 
- Do conversations with people who attract deep thinkers like Uval Harari, Sam Harris
- Present at Singularity Conference
- Work with the astraunots who are preparing for the long stay at the space station, Lunar base, Mars mission
