# Introduction and motivation
I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021 and see objective measurable improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment. 

I have a drive to give back to the VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below you can find the initial ideas that I am discussing with other VortexHealing students.

## VortexHealing documentation
Collaboration on Vortex content 

- finding pictures for each document, protocol, issue series, class
- alternatively, generating pcitures via generative art
- interlinking documents 
- generating table of contents for documents 
- Kindle format and other readers: converting to epub, mobi formats 
- better PR on for markdown
- future: training the AI to answer vortex questions


## Internship program 
There is a gap between graduating from the vortex class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. COnsider this an equivalent of the internship program that 

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with lead practicioner and junior practicioners

## Healing practice development
VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work developement. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. 

- Longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels)
- Preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- Grief counceling (e.g. via hospitals)
- Marriage and relationship support
- Breakup and divorce support 
- Rape cases support
- Long covid help, like clearing pathways for restoring the sense of taste and smell
- Clearing infections, including secondary for covid 
- Lyme desease and long Lyme
- Genmod for known genetic risks (via the national lab networks??)
- Support the therapy and deep wound release  
- Support other mental conditions like Bipolar, Schizophrenia, if due to a virus
- Support for autoimmune deseases, if due to a virus
- New home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.

- Loosing hair 
- Energy system check up and repair (via longevity networks)
