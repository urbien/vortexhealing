# Introduction and motivation
I am practicing VortexHealing since April of 2021. I see objective (measurable) improvements with my health and subjective improvements in my human potential unfoldment, or [self-transcendence](https://www.mistysansom.com/blog/spirituality-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs) in Maslow's pyramid of needs.

This led to a desire to give back to VortexHealing community by applying my professional knowledge in the area of computer science and software engineering. 

Below is a set of potential projects that emmerged from discussions with other VortexHealing students. Those projects, if come to life, will fill the need of VortexHealing community and bring awareness of its magic to people that are not part of it, but could benefit from its healing tools, or could wish to join it.

## Increase accessibility of VortexHealing documentation
I have encountered a number of time the difficulty less technical students experience with class documents. Besides some texts could be made much easier to understand. Currently all the editing of the materials falls onto Ric (or teachers that offer their own unique classes).

Using modern tools and workflows, this burden can be lifted somewhat. One might think that improvement requests could flood Ric's and other teachers inboxes. But advanced students can be assigned the role of reviewing the document improvment requests, suggested by other students. If suggestion needs an improvement, the reviewer can send it back to the submitting student for correction. And only after the approval this could come to Ric for the final ok, where Ric can deny or accept the request, or make an adjustment. Thus students can collaborate with teachers to increase accessibility of class review documents and other VortexHealing content. Below are some ideas on this:

- Solve problems of viewing on mobile devices by automatically converting documents into an HTML format. All modern browsers support HTML zooming and reflowing the content for a narrower view, which PDF does not do at all, and Word does not do on mobiles (I tested with another student an automatic conversion of all doc files into .docx, and from there there is an automatic converstion of all documents to html, epub, wiki, and any other formats one would desire).
- Automatically convert all documents to Kindle and Apple Books formats (that is epub formats. Note that Kindle now uses its own format, but by the end of 2022 they promised to support epub standard). 
- Automatically generate the table of contents for each document (headers in current documents need to be fixed manually for small number of cases where teachers use large font instead of a proper heading)
- Collaboratively edit documents to fix errors in text and improve readability, and to interlink documents to make it easier to find relevant definitions, protocols, and explanations. This can be done either via Google docs, Wikis or via [Github markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/collaboration.html). Those newer tools have long replaced the Word Document worlflow, used still by VortexHealers teachers. 
- Adding relevant art and photos for each document, protocol, issue series, class. Images can come from the following sites: [add suggested sites here].
- Alternatively, generate such art with [generative art](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

## Mirrorring VortexHealers Facebook group
Many students have a strong aversion to Facebook and therefore can't access the treasure trove of information accumulated in the last 10 years on this group. It is a shame many students are not part of the conversation and in a post-COVID world, with most classes moving online, they feel they are disconnected from the community. Many students are not even aware of all the questions that have been asked and answered already, and keep asking them in classes and events. 
An alternative forum capability on VortexHealing.org [was discussed in 2015](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/987140791352536/) by Ric and Anthony, but it never took hold. Perhaps Anthony hit some technical issues or our Facebook forum admins provided some manual support with the help of a pinned thread as a make shift bulletin board. 

The difficulty lies in is not asking students to create Facebook profiles while: 
1) automaticlly posting under their names on FB (hope this will be acceptable for FB-averse students)
2) allowing only registered students to post on the vortexhealing.org forum
3) giving admins an ability to suspend users

Here is the proposed solution, based on some [new tech](https://github.com/mautrix/facebook). It is a bridge between [Matrix](https://matrix.org), the world's [most secure group messaging solution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UlA4-tslROBDS9IqHalWVztqZo7uxlCeKPQ-8uoFOU/edit#gid=0), which is also 100% open source.


- Create a mirror copy of the Facebook group, automatically syncing it to the student area of VortexHealing.org website.
- Allow to post and comment on this website and propagate automatically these posts back to current Facebook Group.

Assuming this works, those who like to continue using Facebook Group will be able to do so without any changes, and the rest of the community can join the conversation.

And even if it does not work for bi-directional syncing, it is still very valuable to sync one-way for a search engine to index 10+ years of conversations on FB Group, and for the AI to learn our vortex lingo.

## Search engine for all things vortex
Many students completely forgot the tools and protocols that were taught in prior classes, and have hard time finding them in docs. Also, finding some prior posts in the Facebook Vortexhealers group is very hard, sometimes takes hours, and sometimes is plain impossible. This is not good. That is even if you know who made the post and know the exact keywords. Modern google-like search should allow to find materials using so called facets (post: or comment:) by a specific person (person:) or or during a specific timeframe (a month ago, a year ago, last 5 years, etc.). 
Search should work across all the materials:

- Vortexhealing.org site, including testimonies, healing stories, etc. (public)
- Ric's books (public, but should only show the limited pages of the book, like Amazon.com does it)
- All VortexHealing documents (non-public, in student area)
- All VortexHealing documents German and Spanish (non-public, in student area)
- Search an archive of Ric's emails (non-public, in student area)
- Search Facebook VortexHealers Group (non-public, in student area, behind a personal student login)

With the above projects we will have a large corpus of text that will help us train AI to improve the quality of automatic language translation for Zoom and for other AI-based projects.

## Research for genmod targets
There is a lot of ideas in Genetics class review manual on what can be done with Genetics tools. What is missing is an ongoing discussion on what worked, what did not. VortexHealers Facebook group has a number of posts on this topic. Yet we need more focused discusson and exploration of progressive improvements in this area based on the new scientific data that arises and based on all the digital measurements and monitoring of the body that can be done nowadays, which was not possible earlier. 

# Healthspan, Anti-aging, Longevity, Youthening, Rejuvenation
Various VortexHealing documents refer to life extension and health span extension techniques given in some classes. The following class documents list anti-aging tools:
- Genetics, your main source
- Jewel: section: "Certain Specific Kinds of Conditions & Tissue Damage to Check for (to heal) with Aging"
- 

VortexHealers group has some posts on the subject:

- [Reversing shortening of telomeres](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1061656497234298/)
- [Improving heart performance and overal stamina](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1982412285158710)
- [Optimizing glands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/964449080288374)
- [Thymus activation](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3395590063840918/?comment_id=3395669413832983) (there were other comments / posts by Ric on FB group but I can't find them, after spending hours on this). Thymus may be key to longevity, see it discussed in my longevity review below.
- [Decreasing elevated blood pressure and sleep disruption](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/3013750192024909). 
- Healthspan genmods. Comments on [this post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/5159360644130509) mention the list given in Genetics class and also list a bunch of additional genmods for healthspan / longevity. Also see this [newer genmod intention](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/4051276051605646/) that Ric discovered in 2021. 

As with genmods for other non-age-related targets, we need consistent research and experimentation in this area. After all, average age of VortexHealing community member is quite high, as this type of inner work requires maturity. If we can address some of the aging procsses, we can do healing of many deseases before and even after they emerge. See my review on recent [longevity breakthroughs](https://github.com/urbien/longevity). Note for example, a recent thymus regrowth experiment which resulted in the whole-body rejuvenation. Ric did an activation of his thymus, inspired by such research (post is somewhere on FB Group..).

# Helping VortexHealing practitioners make a living 
VortexHealing is a healing art and many students are trying to make a living as a full-time healer. Yet most are struggling to sustain themeselves. Below are some ideas on how technology and processes supported by technology might be of help:

## Higher-level students working on lower-level students
I suspect a high percentage of healing income of higher level students comes from healing done on students that started work on their systems fairly recently. Yet in my experience, finding the right healer for a particular issue is very hard, and things to focus on are not so clear. After gathering such info, I find myself constantly advising other students and making referrals to higher level students. It appears just listing healings by the level of their classes taken is helpful but inadequate. So here is an idea: list healers by their core specialty:
- most knowlegeable with formal VortexHEaling protocols and specific tools given in varios classes
- experience with particular types of conditions, e.g. traumas, infections
- intuitives that follow Merlin's lead, zeroing in on what your system needs mpot
- with highly developed sensing to check for specific conditions, energy levels, capable of full inspecion of energetic system and bodily functions, etc.
- those that can help with furthering and deepening the relationship with the Divine
- those that can discover your strongest choice points
- 

### Initial Patient Checkup
MG/UAP/MI projects file states that in the first session with the patient, the healer needs to check for the most disruptive things in patient's system that need to be addressed before moving forward. I received many healing sessions from higher level students and referred a lot of people to to them, and it turns out this checkup is not typically done upfront. Yet, when I specifically asked for it, it turned out I had plenty of nasties in my system, clearing which made a world of difference for me. It is highly beneficial to do such checkup for any new students, and if this is done systematically, it can be a good source of income for healers. So let's build the list:
- Viruses and especially sub-clinical viruses
- Spots of Non-Existence 
- Black hole(s) (1/3 of people would have one)
- Fixations 
- Entanglements
- Divine Structures and Blueprints
- Death spot (everyone has it, needs UAP/MI to clear most of it).
- Gremmies of different kinds
- Other karmic structures

### What would be good to do after Core Veil is gone?
I asked this question to many wizards and did not get a clear answer. So I ended up just clearing the voridians. We all have seen the notes scattered around the class review documents saying that this and that could be done only after Core Veil. Let's gather these up and rate them by the impact. 
Below is the list that I suggest we start building:

1. [Weaken the Network of Networks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1620368921363050/). This will significantly weaken all the conditioning in your system and make it easier to address each issue separately.
2. De-networking room in Quinstel.
3. 

## If I had the money to spend, what should I invest into to upgrade my energetic system?
Let's build the list.  and add the most important steps of the energy system tune up (MG - UAP - MI projects document) that can be done after losing the Core Veil.
- Fix shut down energetic pathways, if any
- Fix shut down voridian nodes, if any 
- Check each organ's energy level, for subtle and physical organs
- Check for damage of the Luminous Egg
- Replenishing Pre-natal Jing, Kidney Essence & Chi (needs MG level)
- Strengthening Constitutional Energies (at Jewel takes 12 hours, or 8 min at MI)
- Repair the conversion from pre-natal Jing to Kidney Essence (needs Genetics level)

## Conditions for which VortexHealing may be helpful
I have spent dozens of hours researching various conditions for myself and friends-and-family. I feel there should be a better way. This is also a way for healers to earn some income, by communicating these on their websites (must be careful with wording to avoid legal issues).
Below is the list I suggest we start building.

**Note: on remote diagnostics**
VortexHealing is not a replacement for medical disgnostics and intervention, but can be used to complement it, e.g. VortexHealing can be used for diagnostics of conditions (e.g. infections, kidney stones, and even tumors), which you can then take to the traditional medical doctor.

### Bodily issues
- Allergies. 
- Autoimmune. In a lot of cases caused by the sub-clinical virus.
- Hypertension (high blood pressure). This can be alleviated if the cause is the sex hormons disbalance that comes with aging. In such case the system tries to compensate and causes sexual energy to backup in kidneys. This excess can be drained (MG/UAP/MI) and genmod (Genetics) can optimize sex hormons production (my free testosterone increased 15 times after the genmod).
- Infections.
- COVID.
- Anemia.
- Headaches.
-  

### Mental health issues 
- Anxiety 
- Autism
- ADHD
- Schizophrenia 
- Bipolar
- 

### Awakening
It is generally assumed In VortexHealing community that for awakening you need classes. It is true, but you can do more. For example, I have worked towards my awakening goals with a number of MI and UAP students as I did not have all the prerequisites yet for the awakening classes. If you have a strong drive and [quite] some money to spend, this is possible. It is also healthy as it is mutually beneficial - hardcore seekers can accelerate their highly desired development and the higher level students can gain extra sustenance.

- Helping you get through 14 energetic movements (there is a separate document on this in student area download section). After the Omega class you will be at the 14th, but if you are one of those spiritual seekers like me who can't wait, below is for you. I have done it, it is possible.
- Help with loosing the Core Veil prior to the Core Veil class. You need 14 EC prior to that and then what worked for me was a number of sessions with the higher level students channeling Presence (Omega level) and Surrender / Grace (Jewel-level).

## VortexHealing practice development
VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work developement. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. Each area below has its own network online and in the physical world, and we need to think of how to integrate with such networks:

- Longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels)
- Preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- Grief counceling (e.g. via hospitals)
- Marriage and relationship support
- Breakup and divorce support. People in sexual relationship grow attacgment cords, and their energy bodies intertwine. This makes breakup much harder and often very painful.
- Rape cases support.
- Long covid help, like clearing pathways for restoring the sense of taste and smell.
- Clearing infections, including secondary for covid. 
- Lyme desease and long Lyme.
- Genmod for known genetic risks (via the national lab networks??).
- Support the therapy and deep wound release.  
- Support other mental conditions like Bipolar, Schizophrenia, if due to a virus.
- Support for autoimmune deseases, if due to a virus.
- New home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.
- Clearing of entities and post clearing restoration.
- Unresolved parent issues.
- Losing weight, improving digestion.
- Loosing hair and developing boldness. 
- Energy system check up and repair (via longevity networks).
- Meridians unreachable with needles (via accupuncturists networks).
- Karmic knots (via Buddhist schools??).
- Fear of exams (via prep schools, tutoring marketplaces).
- Fear of public speaking (e.g. via an MBA school).
- Elected to public office that have deep wound.
- Relief for the side-effects of cancer treatments like chemo or radiation (via marihuana dispenseries??, via dedicated Facebook groups??).

## Zoom tools 
A synchronous translation of classes is important. I have a friend in Germany who does not speak English. What to do for potential students in China, Japan, and other countries that have much lower general knowledge of English than Germany? Lnaguage barrier severely limits the reach of VortexHealing on the planet. Here are some ideas that I partially researched:

- Auto-generation of subtitles for Zoom-based classes in real-time like Youtube does it. Some people can read but it is hard for them to quickly understand the spoken word, especially with Irish, Australian and US Midwest accents.
- [Auto-translation](https://integrately.com/integrations/google-translate/zoom) of those subtitles into other languages
- AI can be trained on VortexHealing corpus of text to improve the quality of the above

## Internship program
There is currently a skills gap between graduating from the VortexHealing class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. Consider this to be an equivalent of the internship program for medical professionals. Internship program needs to provide a revenue stream for teachers or it will be unsustainable. 

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with a lead practitioner and junior practitioners 

## Modular site 
Most healers have no sites or have the rudimentary sites. Create a way to quickly customize a website with standard sections and tools, like these:

- Bio 
- Calendar of events
- Booking to events 
- Auto-reminders for events
- Official Certificate for the current level of VortexHealing training 
- Media: audio and video recordings
- Testimonies
- Catalog: a list of offered services and their prices
- Accept payments 
    - Paypal and credit cards, obviating the need to send emails back and forth
    - Subscriptions to a block of events / sessions
    - Monthly subscriptions

## General VortexHealing awareness program
- Youtube (or Spotify) interviews with VortexHealing teachers, like Ric did with [Awareness Explorers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xv-CELriII)
- Youtube (or Spotify) interviews with students, like Daisy did in 2022 on [Initiating Awakening](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bWjfi75nVFFTtLMbbwHvx) and [Sex and Relationships](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7xtgyqm4zwUwEtLiC8m4Da). I heard some pretty juicy and entrancing stories from VortexHealing students, which I found inspiring for myself, and may inspire others. I know these things work, as I also shared my VortexHealing and Path stories with others, and even though some were higher-level students or at least were doing VortexHealing for much longer than I did, they were encouraged to try some new things and intensify their own practice. 
- Do a TED talk. This can be done both by teachers and students.
- Do a Google Talk like the mindfulness guys did, which opened it up to a completely new audience.
- Do recorded conversations with people who attract deep thinkers like Uval Harari, Sam Harris
- Present at the Singularity Conference. This could bring completely new group of people into VortexHealing.
- Work with the astronauts who are preparing for a long stay at the space station, Lunar base, and for the Mars mission. These extreme situations expose inner unresolved issues. It was well depicted in the show For All Mankind.

## Modular site for VortexHealing Teachers 
Similar to a site for practicioners, but also classes, their reviews, discussions, details on wizard upkeep, as Lorraine calls it and a morning routine, as Terrie does.

## Mobile App
An app to help students with the study and practice (let's discuss what this app could do).
