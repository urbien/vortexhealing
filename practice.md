VortexHealing is a healing art and many students are trying to make a living as a full-time healer. Yet most are struggling to sustain themselves. Below are some ideas on how technology and processes supported by technology might be of help:

## Higher-level students working on lower-level students

I suspect a high percentage of healing income of higher level students comes from healing done on students that started work on their systems fairly recently. Yet in my experience, finding the right healer for a particular issue is very hard, and things to focus on are not so clear. After gathering such info, I find myself constantly advising other students and making referrals to higher level students. It appears just listing healings by the level of their classes taken is helpful but inadequate. So here is an idea: list healers by their core specialty:

- most knowledgeable with formal VortexHEaling protocols and specific tools given in various classes
- experience with particular types of conditions, e.g. traumas, infections
- intuitives that follow Merlin's lead, zeroing in on what your system needs most
- with highly developed sensing to check for specific conditions, energy levels, capable of full inspection of energetic system and bodily functions, etc.
- those that can help with furthering and deepening the relationship with the Divine
- those that can discover your strongest Choice Points
- ..

### Initial Patient Checkup

MG/UAP/MI projects file states that in the first session with the patient, the healer needs to check for the most disruptive things in patient's system that need to be addressed before moving forward. I received many healing sessions from higher level students and referred a lot of people to to them, and it turns out this checkup is not typically done upfront. Yet, when I specifically asked for it, it turned out I had plenty of nasties in my system, clearing which made a world of difference for me. It is highly beneficial to do such checkup for any new students, and if this is done systematically, it can be a good source of income for healers. So let's build the list:

- Viruses, and especially the sub-clinical viruses
- Spots of Non-Existence
- Black hole(s) (1/3 of people would have one)
- Fixations
- Entanglements
- Divine Structures and Blueprints
- Gremmies of different kinds
- Other karmic structures

### What would be good to do after Core Veil is gone?

I asked this question to many wizards and did not get a clear answer. So I ended up just clearing the voridians. We all have seen the notes scattered around the class review documents saying that this and that could be done only after Core Veil. Let's gather these up and rate them by the impact. 
Below is the list that I suggest we start building:

1. [Weaken the Network of Networks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vortexhealers/posts/1620368921363050/). This will significantly weaken all the conditioning in your system and make it easier to address each issue separately.
2. De-networking room in Quinstel.
3. ...

## If I had the money to spend, what should I invest into to upgrade my energetic system?

Let's build the list.  and add the most important steps of the energy system tune up (MG - UAP - MI projects document) that can be done after losing the Core Veil.

- Fix shut down energetic pathways, if any
- Fix shut down voridian nodes, if any 
- Check each organ's energy level, for subtle and physical organs
- Check for damage of the Luminous Egg
- Replenishing Pre-natal Jing, Kidney Essence & Chi (needs MG level)
- Strengthening Constitutional Energies (at Jewel takes 12 hours, or 8 min at MI)
- Repair the conversion from pre-natal Jing to Kidney Essence (needs Genetics level)

## Conditions for which VortexHealing may be helpful

I have spent dozens of hours researching various conditions for myself and friends-and-family. I feel there should be a better way. This is also a way for healers to earn some income, by communicating these on their websites (must be careful with wording to avoid legal issues).
Below is the list I suggest we start building.

**Note: on remote diagnostics**
VortexHealing is not a replacement for medical diagnostics and intervention, but can be used to complement it, e.g. VortexHealing can be used for diagnostics of conditions (e.g. infections, kidney stones, and even tumors), which you can then take to the traditional medical doctor.

### Bodily issues

- Allergies.
- Autoimmune. In a lot of cases caused by the sub-clinical virus.
- Hypertension (high blood pressure). This can be alleviated if the cause is the sex hormonal imbalance that comes with aging. In such case the system tries to compensate and causes sexual energy to backup in kidneys. This excess can be drained (MG/UAP/MI) and genmod (Genetics) can optimize sex hormonal production (my free testosterone increased 15 times after the genmod).
- Infections.
- COVID.
- Anemia.
- Headaches.
- ...

### Mental health issues

- Anxiety
- Autism
- ADHD
- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar
- ...

### Awakening

It is generally assumed In VortexHealing community that for awakening you need classes. It is true, but you can do more. For example, I have worked towards my awakening goals with a number of MI and UAP students as I did not have all the prerequisites yet for the awakening classes. If you have a strong drive and [quite] some money to spend, this is possible. It is also healthy as it is mutually beneficial - hardcore seekers can accelerate their highly desired development and the higher level students can gain extra sustenance.

- Helping you get through 14 energetic movements (there is a separate document on this in student area download section). After the Omega class you will be at the 14th, but if you are one of those spiritual seekers like me who can't wait, below is for you. I have done it, it is possible.
- Help with loosing the Core Veil prior to the Core Veil class. You need 14 EC prior to that and then what worked for me was a number of sessions with the higher level students channeling Presence (Omega level) and Surrender / Grace (Jewel-level).

## VortexHealing practice development

VortexHealing is very impactful but is largely unknown to the general public. Below are some ideas on how to bridge needs of people who don't want to take VortexHealing classes but could use Vortex for their health, lifestyle and work development. One can think of this in terms of referrals, affiliate programs and bridging of existing networks to VortexHealing. Each area below has its own network online and in the physical world, and we need to think of how to integrate with such networks:

- Longevity (e.g. via subscribers to related youtube channels). See a separate article on VortexHealing used for [longevity and anti-aging](aging.md).
- Preparing for death (e.g. via hospice)
- Grief counseling (e.g. via hospitals)
- Marriage and relationship support
- Breakup and divorce support. People in sexual relationship grow attachment cords, and their energy bodies intertwine. This makes breakup much harder and often very painful.
- Rape cases support.
- Long covid help, like clearing pathways for restoring the sense of taste and smell.
- Clearing infections, including secondary for covid. 
- Lyme disease and long Lyme.
- Genmod for known genetic risks (via the national lab networks??).
- Support the therapy and deep wound release.  
- Support other mental conditions like Bipolar, Schizophrenia, if due to a virus.
- Support for autoimmune diseases, if due to a virus.
- New home, new apartment, such as clearing, blessing, creating divine portals.
- Clearing of entities and post-clearing restoration.
- Unresolved parent issues. (see Consciousness Patterning from Relationships in Energy System part 2)
- Losing weight, improving digestion.
- Loosing hair and developing boldness.
- Energy system check up and repair (via longevity networks).
- Meridians unreachable with needles (via acupuncturist networks).
- Karmic knots (via Buddhist schools??).
- Fear of exams (via prep schools, tutoring marketplaces).
- Fear of public speaking (e.g. via an MBA school).
- Elected to public office that have deep wound.
- Relief for the side-effects of cancer treatments like chemo or radiation (via marihuana dispensaries??, via dedicated Facebook groups??).

## Zoom tools

A synchronous translation of classes is important. I have a friend in Germany who does not speak English. What to do for potential students in China, Japan, and other countries that have much lower general knowledge of English than Germany? Lnaguage barrier severely limits the reach of VortexHealing on the planet. Here are some ideas that I partially researched:

- Auto-generation of subtitles for Zoom-based classes in real-time like Youtube does it. Some people can read but it is hard for them to quickly understand the spoken word, especially with Irish, Australian and US Midwest accents.
- [Auto-translation](https://integrately.com/integrations/google-translate/zoom) of those subtitles into other languages
- AI can be trained on VortexHealing corpus of text to improve the quality of the above

## Internship program

There is currently a skills gap between graduating from the VortexHealing class and becoming a professional healer. To successfully bridge that gap, there is a need for more support from teachers. Consider this to be an equivalent of the internship program for medical professionals. Internship program needs to provide a revenue stream for teachers or it will be unsustainable. 

- Energetic support for a group of students doing healing sessions on themselves or a partner
- Monitoring healing sessions of students, review and evaluation afterwards
- Healing office with a lead practitioner and junior practitioners 

## Modular site

Most healers have no sites or have the rudimentary sites. Create a way to quickly customize a website with standard sections and tools, like these:

- Bio 
- Calendar of events
- Booking to events
- Auto-reminders for events
- Official Certificate for the current level of VortexHealing training 
- Media: audio and video recordings
- Testimonies
- Catalog: a list of offered services and their prices
- Accept payments
    - Paypal and credit cards, obviating the need to send emails back and forth
    - Subscriptions to a block of events / sessions
    - Monthly subscriptions

## Modular site for VortexHealing Teachers

Similar to a site for practitioners, but also includes a schedule for classes, class reviews, discussions, details on wizard upkeep (as Lorraine calls it) and a morning routine (as Terrie does).
